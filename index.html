The word 'Ekadashi' comes from Sanskrit: 'eka' meaning one and 'dashi' meaning ten, together meaning eleven. It is considered one of the most sacred days for Hindus, especially devotees of Lord Vishnu. Fasting on Ekadashi is believed to purify the mind and body, burn past karma, and bring one closer to spiritual liberation (moksha). The tradition of Ekadashi fasting has been practiced for thousands of years and is mentioned in various Hindu scriptures including the Padma Purana, Skanda Purana, and Bhagavata Purana."

The key is maintaining a devotional attitude throughout the observance."

The exact timing varies based on: 1) Your geographic location - different cities have different sunrise times. 2) The lunar calendar calculations for that specific Ekadashi. 3) The presence of 'Hari Vasara' - the first quarter of Dwadashi which should be avoided for breaking fast. Typically, fasting lasts about 24-36 hours. For example, if Ekadashi sunrise is at 6:30 AM, you begin fasting then. The next day (Dwadashi), Parana time might be from 6:35 AM to 9:15 AM. You must break your fast within this window for full spiritual benefit. Our calendar provides specific Parana timings for each Ekadashi."

There are different levels of Ekadashi observance: 1) NIRJALA (waterless) - The strictest form where no food or water is consumed. This is primarily observed on Nirjala Ekadashi (June) and is considered equal to observing all 24 Ekadashis. Not recommended for elderly, children, or those with health conditions. 2) PHALAHAR (fruit diet) - Fruits, milk, and water are allowed. Most commonly practiced. 3) EKADASHI ANNA - Only grains are avoided, but other foods and water are permitted. For beginners or those with health constraints, drinking water and having fruits/milk is perfectly acceptable. The spiritual intention and devotion matter more than the strictness of fasting. Always prioritize your health - Lord Vishnu appreciates sincere devotion over physical suffering."

'Nirjala' means 'without water' - devotees observe a complete waterless fast for 24+ hours. This is the most powerful and austere Ekadashi. According to the Brahma Vaivarta Purana, observing this single Ekadashi grants the spiritual merit of observing all 24 Ekadashis in a year. The story goes that Bhima, the mighty Pandava, couldn't fast regularly due to his enormous appetite, so sage Vyasa advised him to observe just this one Ekadashi strictly. The fast is broken the next morning during Parana time with water first, then prasad. Due to its intensity, Nirjala Ekadashi is not recommended for pregnant women, elderly, children, or those with health conditions."

It is believed to burn past karma and accelerate spiritual progress toward moksha (liberation). PHYSICAL BENEFITS - Periodic fasting gives the digestive system rest, promotes detoxification, improves mental clarity, and has been shown to have various health benefits in modern research. ASTRONOMICAL SIGNIFICANCE - The Moon affects Earth's water (tides) and human bodies (70% water). On Ekadashi, the Moon's gravitational pull is optimal for fasting, making digestion naturally slower. SCRIPTURAL IMPORTANCE - The Padma Purana states that Lord Vishnu resides in Ekadashi tithi itself. Observing Ekadashi pleases Lord Vishnu more than any other ritual. The Bhagavata Purana describes it as the 'mother of devotion.' Each Ekadashi story reveals how it saved devotees from sins and granted liberation."

However, they can observe Ekadashi in modified ways: RECOMMENDED APPROACH - Pregnant women can observe a partial fast by having fruits, milk, nuts, and light sattvic foods. Complete fasting is NOT advised as it may affect the baby's development. WHAT SCRIPTURES SAY - The Dharma Shastras specifically exempt pregnant women, nursing mothers, the elderly, children under 8, the seriously ill, and those taking essential medications from strict fasting. ALTERNATIVE OBSERVANCES - Instead of food restriction, pregnant women can: 1) Spend extra time in prayer and meditation, 2) Listen to Vishnu Sahasranama or Ekadashi Mahatmya, 3) Avoid grains while eating other permitted foods, 4) Practice mental fasting (controlling negative thoughts). The principle is that devotion matters more than physical austerity. Lord Vishnu appreciates sincere intention over rigid rules that might harm your health or your baby."

                            <p><strong>Ekadashi</strong> is the eleventh day (tithi) of each lunar fortnight in the Hindu calendar. It occurs <strong>twice a month</strong> – once during the waxing moon (Shukla Paksha) and once during the waning moon (Krishna Paksha).</p>
                            <p>The word comes from Sanskrit: <em>'eka'</em> meaning one and <em>'dashi'</em> meaning ten, together meaning eleven.</p>

                                <p>🙏 Ekadashi is considered one of the most sacred days for Hindus, especially devotees of Lord Vishnu. Fasting on this day is believed to purify the mind and body, burn past karma, and bring one closer to moksha (spiritual liberation).</p>

                            <p>Pregnant women are generally <strong>exempt from strict Ekadashi fasting</strong> according to Hindu scriptures. However, they can observe Ekadashi in modified ways:</p>
                            <div class="faq-highlight">
                                <p>🤰 <strong>Recommended:</strong> Pregnant women can observe a partial fast by having fruits, milk, nuts, and light sattvic foods. Complete fasting is NOT advised as it may affect the baby's development.</p>
                            </div>
                            <p><strong>What scriptures say:</strong> The Dharma Shastras specifically exempt pregnant women, nursing mothers, the elderly, children under 8, the seriously ill, and those taking essential medications from strict fasting.</p>
                            <p><strong>Alternative observances:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Spend extra time in prayer and meditation</li>
                                <li>Listen to Vishnu Sahasranama or Ekadashi Mahatmya</li>
                                <li>Avoid grains while eating other permitted foods</li>
                                <li>Practice mental fasting (controlling negative thoughts)</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>The principle:</strong> Devotion matters more than physical austerity. Lord Vishnu appreciates sincere intention over rigid rules that might harm your health or your baby.</p>
